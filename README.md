## Overview

This repository documents my continuous exploration of Python programming as a computer science student.  
It contains a collection of learning materials, projects, experiments, and utilities built while mastering the language.

Here you’ll find:
- Practical exercises and mini-projects  
- Implementation of core algorithms and data structures  
- Cybersecurity and automation scripts  
- Web development practice (Flask / FastAPI)  
- Notes, references, and research snippets
